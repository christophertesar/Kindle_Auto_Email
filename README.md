# Kindle_Auto_Email
This program mass sends books to specified kindle emails.

# How to use
You can generate a credentials.json file by going to the Gmail API website. By calling `ezgmail.init()` you will automatically be redirected and generate a token.json file.
Depending on where you have your program, you will have to change the directory of your bookfolder.
